I talked about the ex with Guy Katz, Yair Shemer, Itay Tayar and Ortal Glatt.

We wrote software that is a rush-hour game.
During the writing I practiced the basic use of object oriented programming.
I learned to create classes by API and use them in other departments.

#####################
#   Car class-      #
#####################

An object that is a "car" in a rush-hour game.
The class includes four internal attributes of the object-
name, length, location, orientation.

The class includes the functions to create and move the car,
what are the possible moves of the vehicle, where the vehicle is, what
its name is, and to which cell the vehicle will move - in a certain movement.

#####################
#   Board class-    #
#####################

An object that is a game board.
The class includes Two variable values ​​-
A two-dimensional array representing the board itself,
and a dictionary containing the names and objects of the cars in the board.
The class includes Two constants values ​​- The size of the board, and the
victory coordinate.

The class includes the functions to Create and print board,
get the list of all the cells in the game,
get a list that represents all the legal moves in the game,
get the target cell, check if the specific cell is empty,
add a car to the board, and move car in the board.

#   Game class-     #
#####################

An object that is a rush-hour game.
The object coordinates the game board, the participating teams, and game rules.
The class includes Two variable values ​​-
A board type object, which is a game board and dictionary containing the names
and objects of the cars in the game.

The class includes the functions to Create game and And put all the ensembles
according to the json file, And a function that stimulated the game.

The class has private functions, which check the input and the move at each
stage, and constitute a queue or request help in the game.
